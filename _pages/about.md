Hey there,

I'm Ryan, currently pursuing my master's degree in telecommunications at Tarbiat Modares University [(TMU)](https://en.modares.ac.ir/). I'm fortunate to have [Dr. Mokari](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=lrApNV8AAAAJ&hl=en) as my guiding mentor.

I'm all about Telecommunications Security. I explore ways to enhance network security, drawing from a background in air interface. I'm fascinated by technology's role in countering emerging threats, especially through Software Defined Radio (SDR) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) for wireless network security analysis.

Eager to learn and innovate, I'm excited about opportunities in the telecommunications security realm.
