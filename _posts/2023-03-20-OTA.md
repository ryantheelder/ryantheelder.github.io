You can locate all the necessary materials for the tutorial within [this repository](https://github.com/ryantheelder/OTAapplet). 

This post provides a guide on how to install and delete an applet on a phone using OTA SMS. We explain what an applet is, how OTA SMS works, and the potential risks. You'll find clear instructions on how to use OTA SMS to install and delete applets on your phone.

# System Model
Our system consists of the following components:
- **srsenb**: This component acts as the eNodeB and provides the radio access network (RAN) for our system. It allows mobile devices to connect to our network and communicate with other devices.
- **open5gs**: This component acts as the 4G core network and provides the backbone of our system. It is responsible for authenticating and authorizing devices, managing mobility, and providing connectivity between devices.
- **OsmoMSC**: This component acts as the Short Message Service Center (SMSC) and provides the functionality to send SMS messages over the SGS interface. It is responsible for storing and forwarding messages between devices in the network. OsmoMSC also includes support for SMPP (Short Message Peer-to-Peer) protocol, which allows it to act as an SMPP server. This provides an additional way to send and receive SMS messages from the network.
- **OsmoHLR**: This component acts as the Home Location Register (HLR) and provides the functionality to store and manage subscriber information, such as subscriber profiles, access control information, and service information. It is responsible for maintaining the subscriber database and providing the necessary information to support the network operations.

In LTE networks, SMS messages cannot be sent over the same channels as data traffic due to technical reasons. Therefore, a separate interface known as SGs (SMS Gateway to MSC Server) is used to transfer SMS messages between the mobile device and the SMS center. This is why we are using SGs interface in our system model.

Together, these components provide a powerful and flexible system that allows us to send SMS messages over the SGs interface. By using srsenb, open5gs, and OsmoMSC, we are able to create a reliable and efficient network that meets our needs.

# Steps to Install and Delete an Applet via OTA SMS on a Phone
1. Create an applet: First, you need to create an applet that you want to install on the phone. An applet is a small software program that performs a specific task. For example, you can create an applet that displays a message when the phone is turned on.
2. Convert the applet to a binary file: Once you have created the applet, you need to convert it to a binary file. A binary file is a file that contains executable code that can be run on the phone.
3. Send the binary file via OTA SMS: You can send the binary file to the phone via OTA SMS. OTA SMS stands for Over-The-Air SMS, which is a method of sending SMS messages that contain executable code. The phone will receive the OTA SMS and automatically install the applet.
4. Verify the applet installation: Once the applet has been installed, you can verify that it is working correctly by running it on the phone.
5. Delete the applet: To delete the applet from the phone, you can send another OTA SMS message that contains a command to delete the applet. The phone will receive the OTA SMS and automatically delete the applet.

# Installing the Necessary Software Components
To use our system model and perform the steps described in this README.md file, you will need to install the following software components:
## PreReq
```code
~$ sudo apt update
~$ sudo apt upgrade

# Configuring the Software Components
To ensure that the system model works properly, it is important to configure the different software components correctly. Some components, such as the MME, OsmoMSC, and srsENB, are more critical than others and require extra attention during the configuration process.
## OsmoMSC
The OsmoMSC, or Open Source Mobile Switching Center, is responsible for the management of voice and SMS services in the system model. To configure the OsmoMSC, you will need to specify various parameters such as the MSC number, HLR address, and SMSC address. These parameters can be configured using the ```/usr/local/etc/osmocom/osmo-msc.cfg``` file provided by the OsmoMSC project.

This is a sample test configuration.
```code

```

## MME
The MME, or Mobility Management Entity, is a key component of the 4G core network that handles the management of user mobility and authentication. To configure the MME properly, you will need to specify various parameters such as the PLMN ID, TAI list, and security settings. These parameters can be configured using the ```~/repos/open5gs/install/etc/open5gs/mme.conf``` file provided by the Open5GS project.

This is a sample test configuration.

```code

```

## srsENB
The srsENB, or software-defined Radio Access Network eNodeB, is responsible for handling the radio communications between the user devices and the 4G core network. To configure the srsENB, you will need to specify various parameters such as the frequency band, cell ID, and MCC/MNC. These parameters can be configured using the ```/home/gcatcher/.config/srsran/enb.conf``` file provided by the srsENB project.

### Other Components
All the necessary configuration files are provided in the "configs" folder of this repository. To properly run the system, it's essential to correctly configure the MME, OsmoMSC, and srsENB components. Make sure to carefully follow the instructions and modify the configuration files according to your specific setup before running the software.

# How to use?
1. Create an applet: First, you need to create an applet that you want to install on the phone. An applet is a small software program that performs a specific task. For example, you can create an applet that displays a message when the phone is turned on.
2. Convert the applet to a binary file: Once you have created the applet, you need to convert it to a binary file. A binary file is a file that contains executable code that can be run on the phone.
3. Send the binary file via OTA SMS: You can send the binary file to the phone via OTA SMS. OTA SMS stands for Over-The-Air SMS, which is a method of sending SMS messages that contain executable code. The phone will receive the OTA SMS and automatically install the applet.
4. Verify the applet installation: Once the applet has been installed, you can verify that it is working correctly by running it on the phone.
5. Delete the applet: To delete the applet from the phone, you can send another OTA SMS message that contains a command to delete the applet. The phone will receive the OTA SMS and automatically delete the applet.

## 1. Create an Applet and convert it to an APDU
### Shadytel SIM Tools
Shadytel SIM ([Main Project](https://gitea.osmocom.org/sim-card/sim-tools/)) tools are a set of open-source software components that provide support for SIM card emulation and management. The Shadytel SIM Tools project also includes a set of tools for creating Application Protocol Data Units (APDU) that can be used to write SIM Toolkit Applets. SIM Toolkit Applets are small software applications that run on the SIM card and provide additional functionality beyond the standard GSM features.

To download a sample applet and convert it to APDU using Shadytel, follow these steps:

1. Clone the sim-tools repository:
```code
~/repos$ git clone https://github.com/herlesupreeth/sim-tools.git
```
2. Clone the "hello-stk" sample applet and then Build the applet:
```code
~/repos$ git clone https://gitea.osmocom.org/sim-card/hello-stk
~/repos$ cd hello-stk/hello-stk/
~/repos/hello-stk/hello-stk$ make
~/repos/hello-stk/hello-stk$ cd ~/repos/sim-tools/shadysim
```
Run the Shadytel command to convert the applet to APDU:
```code
~/repos/sim-tools/shadysim$ python3 shadysim_isim.py --pcsc -l ~/repos/hello-stk/hello-stk/build/javacard/org/toorcamp/HelloSTK/javacard/HelloSTK.cap -i ~/repos/hello-stk/hello-stk/build/javacard/org/toorcamp/HelloSTK/javacard/HelloSTK.cap \
          --enable-sim-toolkit --module-aid d07002ca44900101 \
          --instance-aid d07002CA44900101 \
          --nonvolatile-memory-required 0100 \ 
          --volatile-memory-for-install 0100 \
          --max-menu-entry-text 15 \
          --max-menu-entries 05 --kic KIC1 \
          --kid KID1 \
          --smpp
```
After converting the sample applet to an APDU, we can send it to the phone using a SMPP client. We can send several APDUs to perform different operations on the phone, such as sending SMS or making calls. To do this, we need to have access to a SMPP server that can handle our requests. In our case, we are using OsmoMSC as the SMPP server. We can send the APDUs to the SIM card by connecting to the SMPP server using a SMPP client. The OsmoMSC will then forward the SMPP messages over the SGS interface to the SRS eNodeB, which will in turn send the SMS messages to the SIM card.

To send an SMS message using an SMPP client, the client first establishes a connection with the SMPP server. This is typically done using the bind operation, which authenticates the client with the server and establishes a session. Once the session is established, the client can send SMS messages to the SMPP server using the submit_sm command.

In the case of our system model and GitHub page, we can use an SMPP client to send APDUs to OsmoMSC, which acts as the SMPP server. The APDUs can be sent as SMS messages using the SMPP protocol, and OsmoMSC will then forward the APDUs to the appropriate SIM card.

The SMPP client code can be found in the smpp directory provided for our system model. The code is written in Python and uses the smpp library to establish a connection with OsmoMSC. Once the connection is established, the client can send APDUs to OsmoMSC using the submit_sm command.

The shadytel command (mentioned above) gives us several APDUs, which are then saved in a list variable named parts.

To delete the applet same process goes on with a little difference:
```code
~/repos/sim-tools/shadysim$ python3 shadysim_isim.py --pcsc -d d07002CA449001 \
          --kic KIC1 \
          --kid KID1 \
          --smpp
```
This command (mentioned above) gives us several APDUs, which are then saved in a list variable named parts. As mentioned in the python code above, there are two list variables named parts, one for deleting and one for installing the applet. You can commnet one of them as you want to install or delete the applet.
## 2. Running open5gs Components
Better to use something like Tmux.
```code
# Terminal 1
~$ ~/repos/open5gs/install/bin/open5gs-mmed
```
```code
# Terminal 2
~$ ~/repos/open5gs/install/bin/open5gs-hssd
```
```code
# Terminal 3
~$ ~/repos/open5gs/install/bin/open5gs-pcrfd
```
```code
# Terminal 4
~$ ~/repos/open5gs/install/bin/open5gs-sgwcd
```
```code
# Terminal 5
~$ ~/repos/open5gs/install/bin/open5gs-sgwud
```
```code
# Terminal 6
~$ ~/repos/open5gs/install/bin/open5gs-smfd
```
```code
# Terminal 7
~$ ~/repos/open5gs/install/bin/open5gs-upfd
```

### 2. Running GSM Components
```code
# Terminal 8
~$ sudo osmo-msc -c /usr/local/etc/osmocom/osmo-msc.cfg
```
```code
# Terminal 9
~$ sudo osmo-hss -c /usr/local/etc/osmocom/osmo-hss.cfg
```

## 3. Register Subscriber Information in HSS (open5gs) database
You can refer to [Open5gs](https://open5gs.org/open5gs/docs/guide/02-building-open5gs-from-sources/) for more information

## 4. Register Subscriber Information in HLR (osmocom) database
Make sure osmo-hlr is running.
```code 
~$ sudo telnet 127.0.0.1 4258
OsmoHLR> enable
OsmoHLR# subscriber imsi THEIMSI create
# Check as bellow (This is a comment)
OsmoHLR# show subscribers all
ID     MSISDN        IMSI              IMEI              NAM
-----  ------------  ----------------  ----------------  -----
1      none          123456789          -------------    CSPS
# Update MSISDN so you can send SMS and OTA (This is a commnet)
OsmoHLR# subscriber imsi THEIMSI update msisdn THEMSISDN
OsmoHLR# show subscribers all

 Subscribers Shown: 1
```
## 5. Run the following Script to install/delete the applet
```code
$ python3 smpp.py
```
